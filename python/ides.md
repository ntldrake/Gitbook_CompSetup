# IDEs


You can always run python commands through the command line or the GUI that comes with the initial download. However, if you have more complex projects, we suggest using an IDE such as PyCharm.

iPython is also a great tool for visualization. I use it constantly in lieu of things I would normally use Excel for (pivot charts).
