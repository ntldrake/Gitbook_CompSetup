# Analytics Computer Setup

### *"Author's" Note*

With this book and the rest of the books I plan on hosting for the general public, I am not trying to take credit for the most of the writing and content within them. They are largely copy/pasted from other sources that I've come across trying to teach myself certain skills over the year. It's a combination of a number of sources, which I try my best to source and give credit to, but understand may be lacking at times. If you see anything that is improperly sourced, please let me know and I'll fix it.

I hope you find these helpful on your path of learning.

Thanks, </br>

## What is this book?
This book is intended to help one setup his/her computer for analytical work. I ask most of my new hires to ensure they go through this in their first week at the job. It's largely designed for a Windows laptop (with Mac or Linux almost all of this is already done for you).
