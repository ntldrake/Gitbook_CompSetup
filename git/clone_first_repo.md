# Clone First Repo

For Github, I'd suggest downloading the Github desktop application. It will allow you to do essentially the same steps as listed in the SourceTree steps below.

##Clone To Local Through SourceTree
In both Bitbucket and Stash, there are simple options to clone a repo through Sourcetree. Below presents a Stash example, But I'll get it updated for Bitbucket soon with a repository you can access. Besides that first, step everything else will be the same though.

1. Navigate to the [Common Code Repo.](http://git.office.comscore.com/projects/AUD/repos/common-code/browse)
2. Click on the clone button in the upper right part of the screen.
3. Click on Clone in Source Tree in the pop up. ![source_trello_clone_img](http://cl.ly/image/0D0y411j0g40/Image%202014-05-04%20at%209.46.20%20PM.png)
4. Source Tree will open to a Clone prompt window.
5. Select the folder you want to place this repository in. This should align with the local folder setup you previously did. Please note that you do not need to create a folder for this specific project as cloning will do that for you. For example, if you are clong the common-code repo, select your `C:\Code\Git\Tools` folder while in the prompt.
6. Let the process run until it completes (shouldn't take long).
7. In Windows Explorer, confirm that you now have a folder for common-code in the folder you selected that has all of the code and a .git subfolder.
