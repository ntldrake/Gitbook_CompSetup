# Install KDiff3

### Download
* Go to [KDiff3 Home Page](http://kdiff3.sourceforge.net/).
* Click on the Download link on the left rail.
* Click to download latest version.
* You will probably be taken to a sourceforge download page. Don't worry that nothing is happening, they normally make you wait a couple seconds before your download will start.
* Follow the executable instructions once downloaded.
    * Everything should be self-explanatory (agree and next).
