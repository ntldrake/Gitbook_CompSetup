# Git


There is a following section on using Git effectively and understanding what it is. You can find all of that information in this [book, which is coming soon](http://shinybox.office.comscore.com/TechFundamentals/git/README.html). But the first thing to do is installation.

### Remote Git Server
You will want to sign up for a remote git server such as [Github](https://github.com/) or [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/). [Stash](https://www.atlassian.com/software/stash) is also a popular option at companies. I would suggest creating both Github and Bitbucket accounts. Github is the more popular and social choice, but Bitbucket offers free private repos.

### Organize Local File Structure

Your life will be immensely better if you setup your local file/folder structure before you start using git.

Here is how my folders are setup, which you don't have to use, but works well for me.

1. Create a folder called `Code` in your `C:\` drive.
2. Create a subfolder called `Git` in `C:\Code`
3. Create subfolders that line up to code categories. Mine currently are:
    * Coursera
    * Github
    * Company
        * Gitbooks
        * Tools
        * Customs
        * Production
